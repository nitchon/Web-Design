# Web-Design-Challenge
Module 11 Challenge

# Description

A data analyst without a tools for web design in their toolbox is just another Twitter user with much on their mind. The internet's role in disseminating information/misinforation is undeniable. With a URL and the click of a button, you can be bombarded with whatever your heart desires. For a data analyst, after the crueling work of cleaning and analyzing, they can easily dip into their toolbox to build a simple website to share their methodology and findings. Having learned the back-end skillset, this module's challenge is an exercise in HTML and CSS/Bootstrap. HTML is the skeleton or layout of a website, while CSS adds eyeliner and lipstick to the website. Bootstrap is an open-source CSS framework that allows elements to be more responsive to different viewports. The trick to avoid ending up on [Web Pages That Suck](http://www.websitesthatsuck.com/) is to be methodical in your markup and styling.

In this respository, there is a Resources folder and a handful of HTML documents. Within the Resources folder, you will find the weather dataset from [Python-API-Challenge](https://github.com/nitchon/python-api-challenge) and the resultant scatter plots of weather conditions at different latitudes. Also in the Resources folder is a Jupyter notebook that coverts the dataset to a HTML table. The HTML documents refer to the various pages of the encompassing website. The index.html document is the home page of the website. The style.css is styling infomation for the webpages. Then I deployed the website on [GitHub Pages](https://nitchon.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge.github.io/).

One of the emphases of this challenge is the responsive layout and Navbar. Bootstrap is kind enough to take care of these elements for me. As the viewport changes, the website adapts to look its best for the user.

# Usage

While the content is rather specific, the markup and styling can be adapted for any use. The methodical approach to the markup gives anyone looking to get into web design a simple template. Navigation is one of the most important elements of a website and the Bootstrap Navbar works wonders. The CSS is not incredibly in-depth, but does take advantage tag and class styling as well as how the browser reads the underlying code to display.
